    <p>Enzo Ferrari was an italian motor racer and entrepreneur, who was also the founder of the Ferrari automobile enterprise. He is my idol because no matter what he did, he always made sure to come out at the top. Having the passion for racing, he founded the Ferrari racing team and sooner or later, Ferrari itself.</p>

    <h3>Racing Career</h3>

        The following year, he left them for Alfa Romeo. In 1929, he pulled together his own team of drivers and engineers for his Scuderia Ferrari racing team. Ferrari competed in his final race in August 1931, since he had married Laura Dominica Garello and has become a father with the birth of his beloved son Dino in January 1932. </p2>

The car scored its first win that year, at the Rome Grand Prix. It even went on to gain victories at the Mille Miglia in 1948, the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1949 and the British Grand Prix in 1951.</p3>
